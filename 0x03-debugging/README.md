In computer programming and software development, debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs within computer programs, software, or systems.

Top debugging techniques include understanding the problem, backtracing, using debugging tools, setting breakpoints, binary search, rubber ducking, log analysis, clustering bugs, taking breaks, and learning from each debugging session.
